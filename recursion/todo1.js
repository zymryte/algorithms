// Most graphical “paint” applications have a ‘paintcan fill’ function that floods part of an image with a certain color.
//  We change the image as if we painted a canvas: a two-dimensional array of integers, where each integer represents a 
// color for that pixel. The canvas Array.length is the Y dimension of our canvas; each spot in the canvas array is a 
// row in our image, with a length equal to our canvas’ X dimension. You are given a canvas (2-dimensional array of 
// integers), starting coordinate (2-element array), and the color to flood (integer value). Build floodFill(canvas2D,startXY,newColor)! 
// Replace a pixel’s color value only if it is the same color as the origin coordinate and is directly adjacent via X or 
// Y to another pixel you will change. 
// Note: diagonally related pixels are not considered adjacent.
// Given canvas2D of:
//  we examine the cells that are directly (not diagonally) adjacent to startXY, which is[2,2]. If any have a value of 3 
// (the original value at startXY), we change its value to 1 (newColor) and repeat the process with its directly-adjacent neighbor cells.
//  We repeat this until the entire zone of similarly-colored cells is changed.
